Ladies and gentlemen,

Imagine a world where computers can understand and communicate with us just as easily as we do with each other. A world where the power of human language is harnessed and integrated into computing, making it more intuitive, efficient, and accessible to everyone. This is not just a dream, it is a reality that we are seeing unfold before our very eyes.

We are at the dawn of a new era in computing, where the power of human language is being adopted and integrated into our technology. This is known as natural language processing, or NLP for short. NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that is focused on the interactions between computers and human languages.

With NLP, computers can now understand and interpret the complexities of human language, and respond in ways that are more intuitive and natural. This is a game-changer for the way we interact with technology.

We are no longer limited by the rigid and often confusing commands of traditional computing. We can now communicate with computers in the same way we do with each other, using natural language and natural dialogue. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for how we use and interact with technology.

The power of NLP lies in its ability to bring people and technology together in a way that is more seamless and intuitive. It makes computing more accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds, and it allows us to harness the power of technology to solve some of the world's most pressing problems.

So I ask you, what will you do with this new power? How will you use it to make a positive impact in the world? The possibilities are endless, and the future is in our hands. Let's work together to make the most of this incredible opportunity, and create a world where the power of human language and computing are in perfect harmony.

Thank you.
